				<a href="https://github.com/lovasoa/whitebophir"
					title="Free as in free speech, not free beer. This software is released under the GPL license">free
					and open-source</a>
				online collaborative whiteboard that allows many users to draw
				simultaneously on a large
				virtual board.
				The board is updated in real time for all connected users, and its state is always persisted.
				It can be used for many different purposes, including art, entertainment, design and teaching.
			</p>
			<p>
				To collaborate on a drawing in real time with someone, just send them its URL.

				The <strong>public board</strong> is accessible to everyone.
				It is a happily disorganized mess where you can meet with anonymous strangers and draw together.
				Everything there is ephemeral.

			<p>You can create a <strong>private board</strong> with a random name, that will be accessible only by its
				link.
				Use this if you want to share private information.
